## Prototyping

Prototyping refers to the process of developing upon an established idea or as termed ‘prototype’, which is used as an early representation of part or all of an interactive system. Essentially a prototype is a tangible model I.e. an early example in which a new working product can be derived.

### Forms of Prototyping

#### Evolutionary prototype

An evolutionary prototype is a robust prototype that is constantly refined to represent alterations of a product, potentional future concepts or state of the art demonstrations. 
#### Throwaway Prototype

A throwaway prototype is a cheap, fast prototype that is designed to model an idea or feature. The prototype is commonly used in early phases of design, whilst ideas are still being considered.Though Throwaway prototypes can also be used during late stage design in industries in which products are launched at a low state of refinement.

#### Feasibility prototype

An feasability prototype is usually developed to determine the feasability of various solutions,through exploring the technical constraints, determining whether features are carried forward, discarded or revised.Thus providing insights and removing the possibility of technical issues such as; performance, component compatibility, optimization, etc., occuring or cropping up later in development.

#### Horizontal prototype
Horizontal Prototypes are in essence User Interface prototypes detailing a broad view of an entire system or subsystem, focusing on user interaction and relationships, rather than low-level-functionality.The Horizontal Prototype is developed to; define project scope and demonstrate the external features of the system (e.g., windows, menu bars, and reports, visual elements), as a means of communicating an understanding of the requirement. 


#### Vertical prototype

A Vertical prototype in constrast to a Horizontal prototype is a detailed elaboration of a specific function or a sub system in the product and is developed to show the internal features and relationships within the system, as a means of communicating an understanding of the requirement. 

#### Functional storyboard
A storyboard is a graphical organiser and is used in relation to software development in the early stages of development as an illustration of the product shown in a sequence to represent and show how the software will function, used for reference by the development team.

#### Wireframe

Wireframes are essentially a low-fidelity mockup or skeletal prototype detailing the layout using placeholders to represent UI elements and are used early on in the development life cycle to document design and validate information architecture and user flow. However the common misconception is that wireframes are prototypes and whilst a wireframe is to a certain degree a prototype and can be refined and redesigned into an interactive prototype. It is important to note a wireframe, in the aspect of presentation is more suitable for static display, whilst a prototype is more dynamic and interactive. Moreover in the aspect of function a prototype represents the final product,simulating user interface interaction and is commonly used for potentional user testing. Wireframes on the otherhand are often used during the early stages of development to show layouts and functions for discussion and feedback. In conclusion a wireframe is essentially the skeleton of a product, whilst prototypes are more of a visual reprentation and while recent trends have seen the line between wireframes and prototypes distort and merge each serve unique and distinct roles in the design proccess.


### End User Requirements

End user or user acceptance testing  pertains to the phase of rolling out software to user's,in which feedback and data is gathered based on issues and opinionated views formed during the experience and interaction with the product. Essentially end user testing as the name implies is another form of testing the product to see whether it meets set criteria and user requirements/expectations of what the user expects the software to do (was it functioning as expected,etc.).

Beta & Alpha testing

Alpha testing is a type of acceptance testing; performed during project development in orderto identify all possible issues/bugs before releasing the product to users. The primary focus of this testing is to simulate real users by using blackbox and whitebox techniques. The aim is to carry out the tasks that a typical user might perform.

Beta testing is performed through utilising a real enviroment in which user's and the public use the software as intended and go through the steps as they usually would with the exception of reporting any issues they might have encountered during this proccess.This method allows developers to garner feedback through the perspective of a user, fix issues and use said feeback to mould the software to better fit the user requirements or what a user excepts out of the software.
