## Prototyping

Prototyping refers to the process of developing upon an established idea or as termed ‘prototype’, which is used as an early representation of part or all of an interactive system. Essentially a prototype is a tangible model I.e. an early example in which a new working product can be derived.

### Forms of Prototyping

#### Evolutionary prototype

An evolutionary prototype is a robust prototype that is constantly refined to represent alterations of a product, potentional future concepts or state of the art demonstrations. 
#### Throwaway Prototype

A throwaway prototype is a cheap, fast prototype that is designed to model an idea or feature. The prototype is commonly used in early phases of design, whilst ideas are still being considered.Though Throwaway prototypes can also be used during late stage design in industries in which products are launched at a low state of refinement.

#### Feasibility prototype

An feasability prototype is usually developed to determine the feasability of various solutions,through exploring the technical constraints, determining whether features are carried forward, discarded or revised.Thus providing insights and removing the possibility of technical issues such as; performance, component compatibility, optimization, etc., occuring or cropping up later in development.

#### Horizontal prototype
Horizontal Prototypes are in essence User Interface prototypes detailing a broad view of an entire system or subsystem, focusing on user interaction and relationships, rather than low-level-functionality.The Horizontal Prototype is developed to; define project scope and demonstrate the external features of the system (e.g., windows, menu bars, and reports, visual elements), as a means of communicating an understanding of the requirement. 

#### Vertical prototype

A Vertical prototype in constrast to a Horizontal prototype is a detailed elaboration of a specific function or a sub system in the product and is developed to show the internal features and relationships within the system, as a means of communicating an understanding of the requirement. 

#### Functional storyboard
A storyboard is a graphical organiser and is used in relation to software development in the early stages of development as an illustration of the product shown in a sequence to represent and show how the software will function, used for reference by the development team.

#### Wireframe

Wireframes are essentially a low-fidelity mockup or skeletal prototype detailing the layout using placeholders to represent UI elements and are used early on in the development life cycle to document design and validate information architecture and user flow. However the common misconception is that wireframes are prototypes and whilst a wireframe is to a certain degree a prototype and can be refined and redesigned into an interactive prototype. It is important to note a wireframe, in the aspect of presentation is more suitable for static display, whilst a prototype is more dynamic and interactive. Moreover in the aspect of function a prototype represents the final product,simulating user interface interaction and is commonly used for potentional user testing. Wireframes on the otherhand are often used during the early stages of development to show layouts and functions for discussion and feedback. In conclusion a wireframe is essentially the skeleton of a product, whilst prototypes are more of a visual reprentation and while recent trends have seen the line between wireframes and prototypes distort and merge each serve unique and distinct roles in the design proccess.

### End User Requirements

End user or user acceptance testing  pertains to the phase of rolling out software to user's,in which feedback and data is gathered based on issues and opinionated views formed during the experience and interaction with the product. Essentially end user testing as the name implies is another form of testing the product to see whether it meets set criteria and user requirements/expectations of what the user expects the software to do (was it functioning as expected,etc.).

#### Beta & Alpha testing

Alpha testing is a type of acceptance testing; performed during project development in orderto identify all possible issues/bugs before releasing the product to users. The primary focus of this testing is to simulate real users by using blackbox and whitebox techniques. The aim is to carry out the tasks that a typical user might perform.

Beta testing is performed through utilising a real enviroment in which user's and the public use the software as intended and go through the steps as they usually would with the exception of reporting any issues they might have encountered during this proccess.This method allows developers to garner feedback through the perspective of a user, fix issues and use said feeback to mould the software to better fit the end user requirements or what and how the user expects the software to look and function.

#### Black box testing
Black Box Testing is often categorized as functional testing, but can, to some extent, be seen as a type of User Acceptance Testing.It’s a method of software testing which analyzes certain functionalities without letting testers see the internal code structure.Throughout the test the user is only aware of the softwares purpose not how it should function. Black Box Testing is part of User Acceptance Testing, because Black Box Tests share the same principles as UAT (User-Acceptance-Testing).

#### Regulation Testing 
Regulation Acceptance Testing, also known as Compliance Acceptance Testing, examines whether the software complies with the regulations. This includes governmental and legal regulations.In relation to the games industry each platform i.e. XB1,Nintendo and PS4 each have there own regulations that need to be met and there own group of testers that will test the game based on said regulations, the reason for this is to ensure functionality,ease of use and consistency across all titles.


#### Contract Acceptance Testing
Contract Acceptance Testing pertains to testing developed software to predefined criteria or specifications agreed upon in a contract. The project team defines the relevant criteria and specifications for acceptance at the same time when the team agrees on the contract itself.

#### Operational Acceptance Testing
Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT) is a non-functional software testing method,used to check the readiness of software and is usually conducted after user acceptance testing and is a final verification before a system is released.This testing typically employs real users accessing and using the system in a live state, with user's providing feedback and verifying whether the software elements display and function properly. 

### Prototyping Tools


#### Low fidelity prototype & tools
Low-fidelity prototyping[2] (wireframes are low fidelity prototypes) is a quick and easy way to translate high-level design concepts into tangible and testable artifacts.The basic characteristics of low-fidelity prototyping: Visual design, Content, Interactivity.

The benefits of using low fidelity prototypes is that major problems are detected and solved in the early stage of development cycle, being easier to build and cost less than other alternatives.Whilst low fidelity prototypes are easy to iterate and also give feedback to focus on high-level concepts rather than details

 • Paper Based:Pen and paper a basic tool that allows quick illustration of ideas, facilitating the internal discussion between group
 members.
 
 • MockPlus: Mockplus as a low-fidelity prototyping tool has garnered much attention in recent years. The interface, components, and icons of this software are based on gray color. Through drawing a low fidelity with Mockplus,it is possible to get a low fidelity prototype without adding UI design and complex interaction. Mockplus can also facilitate medium fidelity prototypes, with the inclusion of rich custom properties and powerful interactive features and is regarded as an optimal software to use for beginners. 
 
 • Balsamiq mockups: Balsamiq is a hand-painted low-fidelity prototyping tool.The benefits of Balsamiq as a tool is evident through the fact it can be seen as a low fidelity prototype.Moreover Balsamiq includes a built-in hand-painted UI library that can be used as placeholders for the original UI.However the downside of Balsamiq is that it lacks support for basic interactions, which depending on the situation is not convenient.
 
####  Basic Prototyping & Collaboration

#### High Fidelity Tools
High-fidelity prototyping[3] refers to a computer based interactive representation of a product in its closest resemblance to the final design in terms of details and functionality. High fidelity wrieframes are often drafted near the end of the design process to communicate design decisions to the development team prior to coding the final product.


### Prisma 

#### End User categorisation/classification
End user's can be segregated into two catagorys; Contemporary and those whom are not. Contemporary refering to those whom follow the modern style and are generally more experienced in this genre. Further delving into the term contemporary based on the following of modern design, contemporary users can be put into two types; intermittent and expert user's with the third novice falling out of the range as the term novice is usually used to describe a user new to the genre or technology.Theses catagorys provide the basis on which the application 'Prisma' (a project in development) will be formed upon as the application is aiming to meet the expectations of those under the cotemporary catagory, whom support the third person action franchise. Though the game is not restricted to a contemporary demographic as support basis for novice users will be provided (turtorials). In addition concerning the formulation of prototypes and testing novice user's tend to provide information concerning bugs the best as they still are not aware as to how the game should function thus, should provide the most optimal and raw results, giving input on the application that may not conform to the norm. Though intermittent and expert user's can also provide information benifical to the project as this demographic should already know what to expect from a game in this genre, as stated novice user's tend to stray away from what is deemed the norm demonstrating user behaviours and user ease of use (ease of use refering to how hard the application is to  navigate,play,etc.).

#### Behavioural Models


#### Prisma metholodgy and test plan
This section covers the audience for the project 'Prisma' along with the metholodgy set to be used for the development of multiple prototypes and the core application. Though not limited to the scope, Prismas target audience is set to extend primarly to players whom enjoy third person action games. Tutorial like elements and features will also be implemented in order to ensure ease of use for players new to the genre. 

Furthermore the prototyping methodlogy that the development will be based around is Throw-away’ or ‘Rapid’. Throw-away’ or ‘Rapid’ , which pertains to developing a small part of a system, then giving it to the end user to try out and evaluate. The user provides feedback which can quickly be incorporated into the development of the main system. The prototype is then discarded or thrown away. Rapid/Throwaway prototyping essentially helps to ascertain a complete set of user requirements.

More advantages of utilising rapid prototyping relate to involving customers at an early stage of development as a complete set of customer requirements can be obtained through the feedback, thus also better meeting the final product's need. Though the disadvantages of rapid prototyping are that project management is ignored and poorly operating prototypes that don't meet quality assurance standards are delivered to consumers.

#### Prototyping tools

#### Unreal
Unreal engine is a complete suite of tools developed by Epic Games used primarily for the development of applications though can also be used for a variety of other reasons. The engine is heavily focused on design and detail with its fourth installment or update being released on September 4, 2014, although a stable release wasnt avaliable until recently on November 7, 2018. This engine allows for development without the need to code through the use of Blueprint visual scripting which is node-based enabling developers to create prototypes quickly.The benefits of Blue print visual scripting can be seen through the fact that developers can create full games using only Blueprint.Furthermore unreal is a next-gen game engine that offers advanced graphics capabilities, such as complex partition system and dynamic lighting.

#### Unity
Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, used primarily to create games though can also be manipulated to create applications not related to the gaming industry.The engine supports a number of ile formats also giving access to numerous free assets through the unity asset merket place. Moreover unity also includes Graphics rendering, next-gen runtime, and artist tooling.Unity uses mostly C# or JavaScript, also providing an intuitive interface which is easy to use. Inregards to making prototypes unity has pre-built functions (plug-ins) that can be used inaddition to the assets on the unity asset store this means in theory that no coding, animating or modeling would be required to make prototypes. 

#### Conclusion
The engine in which will be used for creating prototypes of 'Prisma' will be Unity, this is primarily due to Unitys better and intuitive interface to follow and learn from. In addition to the learning material available in contrast to Unreals lack off tutorials and sophisticated interface and doesn’t facilitate ease of use. Although Unreal offers more in terms of cross platform compatibility and prioritises graphics due to the nature of the project, cross platform compatibility is not necessary as the application is set to run on PC. In continuation to the prior point Unreal others offers advanced graphics capabilities, such as complex partition system and dynamic lighting.In comparision Unity 5 is capable of producing graphics heavy environments, though it is also important to note unitys new iteration (2018) boasts features that rival if not eclispse Unreal in regards to graphics and lighting.Furthermore based on the familiarity with the software and ease of use unity was chosen.  

### Prisma Camera demo
The following prototypes include a basic camera system,using animations to move the player in order to test how the camera functions. Although crude, the purpose of the prototypes are to merely test out the camera and how it reacts to object movement,hence why animations were used for the movement rather than a mesh of code and animations.In addition to unitys rigidbody and capsule collider in order to ensure the object does not fall through the floor and to simulate physics. Moreover as theses prototypes explore more of the functional side rather than the asthetics,the canvas consists of a basic untextured plane and a textured playermodel, excluding the need for other objects as this is merely a camera test.

| V1            |User          |Result        |
| ------------- |------------- |------------- |
|               | Luke Bruni   | The camera felt sensitive and the object seemed to follow the camera ruining immersion at times and looking weird.|
|               | Luke Shead   | The camera functions properly and I was impressed by how smooth it looked, however upon moving the character it appeared that the camera was unable to keep up.|
|               | Mark Biswell | Camera input felt too sensitive, while the object also moved to where the camera was pointing appearing unrealistic.|
|               | Joe Williams | Camera felt smooth, however the 360 turning could be toned down and is slightly annoying when trying to move the player.|

Through anaylising the feedback gathered it is clear that there is an issue with the player object and camera 

| V2            |User          |Result        |
| ------------- |------------- |------------- |
|               | Luke Bruni   |              |
|               | Luke Shead   |              |
|               | Mark Biswell |              |
|               | Joe Williams |              |

The temporary fix for the player models axis changing and following the camera point was to add a clamp to the Y axis temporary and as gathered from the feedback given about the second iteration it has seemed to have fixed the issue for now. Though this fix can only be short term otherwise it will impeed on the players ability to look up. The clamp for the X axis was also changed in order to facilitate the feedback gathered from Joe williams whom stated originally that "the 360 turning could be toned down", through clamping the X axis it is now easier to navigate where the user wishes the player to look and go.Moreover the sensitivity was altered using the 'input sensitivity variable' and 'camera speed' to slow down the rate in which the camera turned.
