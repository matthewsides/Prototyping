## Prototyping

Prototyping refers to the process of developing upon an established idea or as termed ‘prototype’, which is used as an early representation of part or all of an interactive system. Essentially a prototype is a tangible model I.e. an early example in which a new working product can be derived.

### Forms of Prototyping

#### Evolutionary prototype

An evolutionary prototype is a robust prototype that is constantly refined to represent alterations of a product, potentional future concepts or state of the art demonstrations. 
#### Throwaway Prototype

A throwaway prototype is a cheap, fast prototype that is designed to model an idea or feature. The prototype is commonly used in early phases of design, whilst ideas are still being considered.Though Throwaway prototypes can also be used during late stage design in industries in which products are launched at a low state of refinement.

#### Feasibility prototype

An feasability prototype is usually developed to determine the feasability of various solutions,through exploring the technical constraints, determining whether features are carried forward, discarded or revised.Thus providing insights and removing the possibility of technical issues such as; performance, component compatibility, optimization, etc., occuring or cropping up later in development.

#### Horizontal prototype
Horizontal Prototypes are in essence User Interface prototypes detailing a broad view of an entire system or subsystem, focusing on user interaction and relationships, rather than low-level-functionality.The Horizontal Prototype is developed to; define project scope and demonstrate the external features of the system (e.g., windows, menu bars, and reports, visual elements), as a means of communicating an understanding of the requirement. 

#### Vertical prototype

A Vertical prototype in constrast to a Horizontal prototype is a detailed elaboration of a specific function or a sub system in the product and is developed to show the internal features and relationships within the system, as a means of communicating an understanding of the requirement. 

#### Functional storyboard
A storyboard is a graphical organiser and is used in relation to software development in the early stages of development as an illustration of the product shown in a sequence to represent and show how the software will function, used for reference by the development team.

#### Wireframe

Wireframes are essentially a low-fidelity mockup or skeletal prototype detailing the layout using placeholders to represent UI elements and are used early on in the development life cycle to document design and validate information architecture and user flow. However the common misconception is that wireframes are prototypes and whilst a wireframe is to a certain degree a prototype and can be refined and redesigned into an interactive prototype. It is important to note a wireframe, in the aspect of presentation is more suitable for static display, whilst a prototype is more dynamic and interactive. Moreover in the aspect of function a prototype represents the final product,simulating user interface interaction and is commonly used for potentional user testing. Wireframes on the otherhand are often used during the early stages of development to show layouts and functions for discussion and feedback. In conclusion a wireframe is essentially the skeleton of a product, whilst prototypes are more of a visual reprentation and while recent trends have seen the line between wireframes and prototypes distort and merge each serve unique and distinct roles in the design proccess.

### End User Requirements

End user or user acceptance testing  pertains to the phase of rolling out software to user's,in which feedback and data is gathered based on issues and opinionated views formed during the experience and interaction with the product. Essentially end user testing as the name implies is another form of testing the product to see whether it meets set criteria and user requirements/expectations of what the user expects the software to do (was it functioning as expected,etc.).

#### Beta & Alpha testing

Alpha testing is a type of acceptance testing; performed during project development in orderto identify all possible issues/bugs before releasing the product to users. The primary focus of this testing is to simulate real users by using blackbox and whitebox techniques. The aim is to carry out the tasks that a typical user might perform.

Beta testing is performed through utilising a real enviroment in which user's and the public use the software as intended and go through the steps as they usually would with the exception of reporting any issues they might have encountered during this proccess.This method allows developers to garner feedback through the perspective of a user, fix issues and use said feeback to mould the software to better fit the end user requirements or what and how the user expects the software to look and function.

#### Black box testing
Black Box Testing is often categorized as functional testing, but can, to some extent, be seen as a type of User Acceptance Testing.It’s a method of software testing which analyzes certain functionalities without letting testers see the internal code structure.Throughout the test the user is only aware of the softwares purpose not how it should function. Black Box Testing is part of User Acceptance Testing, because Black Box Tests share the same principles as UAT (User-Acceptance-Testing).

#### Regulation Testing 
Regulation Acceptance Testing, also known as Compliance Acceptance Testing, examines whether the software complies with the regulations. This includes governmental and legal regulations.In relation to the games industry each platform i.e. XB1,Nintendo and PS4 each have there own regulations that need to be met and there own group of testers that will test the game based on said regulations, the reason for this is to ensure functionality,ease of use and consistency across all titles.


#### Contract Acceptance Testing
Contract Acceptance Testing pertains to testing developed software to predefined criteria or specifications agreed upon in a contract. The project team defines the relevant criteria and specifications for acceptance at the same time when the team agrees on the contract itself.

#### Operational Acceptance Testing
Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT) is a non-functional software testing method,used to check the readiness of software and is usually conducted after user acceptance testing and is a final verification before a system is released.This testing typically employs real users accessing and using the system in a live state, with user's providing feedback and verifying whether the software elements display and function properly. 

### Prototyping Tools


#### Low fidelity prototype & tools
Low-fidelity prototyping[2] (wireframes are low fidelity prototypes) is a quick and easy way to translate high-level design concepts into tangible and testable artifacts.The basic characteristics of low-fidelity prototyping: Visual design, Content, Interactivity.

The benefits of using low fidelity prototypes is that major problems are detected and solved in the early stage of development cycle, being easier to build and cost less than other alternatives.Whilst low fidelity prototypes are easy to iterate and also give feedback to focus on high-level concepts rather than details

 • Paper Based:Pen and paper a basic tool that allows quick illustration of ideas, facilitating the internal discussion between group
 members.
 
 • MockPlus: Mockplus as a low-fidelity prototyping tool has garnered much attention in recent years. The interface, components, and icons of this software are based on gray color. Through drawing a low fidelity with Mockplus,it is possible to get a low fidelity prototype without adding UI design and complex interaction. Mockplus can also facilitate medium fidelity prototypes, with the inclusion of rich custom properties and powerful interactive features and is regarded as an optimal software to use for beginners. 
 
 • Balsamiq mockups: Balsamiq is a hand-painted low-fidelity prototyping tool.The benefits of Balsamiq as a tool is evident through the fact it can be seen as a low fidelity prototype.Moreover Balsamiq includes a built-in hand-painted UI library that cn be used as placeholders for the original UI.However the downside of Balsamiq is that it lacks support for basic interactions, which depending on the situation is not convenient.
 
####  Basic Prototyping & Collaboration

#### High Fidelity Tools
High-fidelity prototyping[3] refers to a computer based interactive representation of a product in its closest resemblance to the final design in terms of details and functionality. High fidelity wrieframes are often drafted near the end of the design process to communicate design decisions to the development team prior to coding the final product.


### Prisma 
End user's can be segregated into two catagorys; Contemporary and those whom are not. Contemporary refering to those whom follow the modern style and are generally more experienced in this genre. Further delving into the term contemporary based on the following of modern design, contemporary users can be put into two types; intermittent and expert user's with the third novice falling out of the range as the term novice is usually used to describe a user new to the genre or technology. In relation to 'Prisma' a personal project the target audience should if properly implemented cover those under the cotemporary catagory though not limited to said catagory and will provide support basis for novice users 

In relation to the Project 'Prisma' 

Prisma utilised user cube to classify end users (Cotterman and Kumar 1989) based on the development, operation,
and control dimensions of end user computing (EUC). Using this cube, users can be classified into eight
distinct groups.


End User's in relation to the project 'Prisma' 

end user classification scheme proposed by Rockart and
Flannery (1983) more than two decades ago. This scheme is inadequate to classify contemporary end users
since it is based mainly on their knowledge and ignores other crucial dimensions such as control.  


Prisma in this regard is set to cater to the 


If a less broader term  

Further using less broader terms end  users can also be delegated into three types; Novices, intermittent and expert. 


Contemporary End users,

The demographic inwhich Prisma is aiming to satiate 

End user's,disregarding age and gender demographics other then can be segregated into three catagorys; Novice, intermittent and expert.

Users can however, be classified in any other way that is appropriate to the system being built.
