## Prototyping

Prototyping refers to the process of developing upon an established idea or as termed ‘prototype’, which is used as an early representation of part or all of an interactive system. Essentially a prototype is a tangible model I.e. an early example in which a new working product can be derived.

### Forms of Prototyping

#### Concept prototype


#### Feasibility prototype

An feasability prototype is usually developed to determine the feasability of various solutions,through exploring the technical constraints, determining whether features are carried forward, discarded or revised.Thus providing insights and removing the possibility of technical issues such as; performance, component compatibility, optimization, etc., occuring or cropping up later in development.

#### Horizontal prototype
Horizontal Prototypes are in essence User Interface prototypes detailing a broad view of an entire system or subsystem, focusing on user interaction and relationships, rather than low-level-functionality.The Horizontal Prototype is developed to; define project scope and demonstrate the external features of the system (e.g., windows, menu bars, and reports, visual elements), as a means of communicating an understanding of the requirement. 
 


#### Vertical prototype

A Vertical prototype in constrast to a Horizontal prototype is a detailed elaboration of a specific function or a sub system in the product and is developed to show the internal features and relationships within the system, as a means of communicating an understanding of the requirement.
